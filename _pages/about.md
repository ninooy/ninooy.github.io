<b><i>BIOGRAPHY</i></b>

I am a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at <b><span style="color:red"> Korea University</span></b> studying robotics, with a preference for first-principles, equation-driven problem-solving. My current focus is optimal robot design through hardware CAD and physics-based simulation using MuJoCo. I spent a year as a research intern at <b>the Robogram Lab, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)</b>, where I developed a framework to determine the optimal shoulder angle for a 7-DoF humanoid arm and designed and assembled a backdrivable, parallel ball-screw wrist mechanism for human–robot interaction.

I have been admitted to <b>Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology(KAIST)’s Department of Mechanical Engineering</b> through the REPS track and will begin research in <b>the DRCD Lab</b> from Spring 2026.

For further information, please refer to my CV!
