  "summary": "I am a robotics researcher who enjoys understanding and designing systems through the lens of dynamics. [cite: 4] From physical prototyping to simulation and control, I approach problems by grounding them in models that reflect how robots actually move, react, and interact with the world. [cite: 5] My work integrates hands-on hardware development with model-based reasoning, and I'm particularly drawn to challenges where analytical structure and physical intuition come together.
