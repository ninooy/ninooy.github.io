It was quite a long journey for a conference visit. I arrived on 17 October (Fri) and returned to Korea on 24 October (Fri).
Looking back, this trip became a turning point for me.

Visiting China especially Shanghai and Hangzhou completely changed my perspective. The level of technology in China right now is astonishing. Whenever I read recent papers, I notice that Chinese researchers appear in almost every author list. And when I occasionally watch robotics videos on YouTube, I often find myself speechless😮. Seeing those very robots in person during the conference was incredible. the performance I had only seen online was happening right in front of me.

I’d like to share that experience in detail through this blog.

On a more personal note, I also spent wonderful time with my cousin Gun-Wook (건욱), who guided me around Shanghai. I honestly cannot imagine how difficult the trip would have been without his help. I’m also grateful to Seol-Sa-Yeon (설사연), his girlfriend, who took me to some of the most popular spots in the city.

So, with all that said

> Let’s dive into the story.

When I went through immigration, a Chinese police officer suddenly stopped me. Since I bulked up to 95 kg, my current face didn’t quite match the photo in my passport. At least, that’s my best guess. They spoke entirely in Chinese, so I had absolutely no idea what they were saying. I just waited for about 30 minutes until they finally approved my entry into Shanghai. In the end, I showed them my conference invitation letter. Honestly, I should have shown it earlier 😅.

After that little incident, I met my cousin and his friend. At first, I thought she was just someone interested in Korean culture, you know, the whole K-something syndrome going around these days. But I was completely wrong. She was actually my cousin’s girlfriend, and she kindly offered to drive me home. It was my first time meeting her, and seeing my cousin with a girlfriend made me realize that he’s getting older too… just like me. It felt strangely funny and heart warming at the same time 🤩.

With my cousin, we talked about so many things. We shared a lot, especially about our big family. I used to teach him math, and honestly, he never listened back then. But now he was guiding me around the entire city, speaking Chinese fluently, and even studying international trade.

If you asked me back then, I never would’ve imagined any of this happening 😂.
That was probably the happiest part of the trip having the kind of conversations you can only really share with family.

We talked about a lot of things good news, bad news, life changes and it hit me that we’ve grown a lot. We used to talk only about video games, but now we’re talking about our futures. It really felt like both of us were getting older and becoming more mature.

Maybe that’s why the beer tasted extra good that night.
And honestly, nothing pairs better with beer than lamb skewers. Absolutely nothing.

I visited one of the famous shengjianbao restaurants in Shanghai. I already knew that Chinese food tends to be oily, but the dumplings were even greasier than I expected. What surprised me the most, though, was that even though the place is Michelin-recommended, the restroom wasn’t as clean as I imagined.

So, if anyone is planning to travel to China, here’s a small tip: many bathrooms are still squat-style, and some may not be as clean as you’d expect. Just something to keep in mind before you go.

I spent some time relaxing while walking around the Bund and the Oriental Pearl Tower area. Recently, I found out that the “Labubu” figures are insanely popular, so I went to a POP MART store hoping to get one. But by the time I got there, everything was already taken. People were literally walking out with entire boxes, so someone like me who just wanted one basically had no chance. I ended up doing the blind grabbing box machine and walked away empty handed.

I also visited the Huawei, Xiaomi, and BYD stores to check out their latest products, including their triple fold phones. I actually saw Samsung demonstrate this technology about three years ago, so seeing China push it forward made me feel like an interesting competition is coming.

And at the Mercedes showroom, I got to see how they envision their future concept cars, which was pretty inspiring.

I went to Xintiandi, which is often described as a European-style street, and had a cup of coffee while preparing my script for the oral presentation that was scheduled for the day after next. Among all the places I visited in Shanghai, Xintiandi definitely had the biggest crowds.

In most academic conferences, it is quite normal to have more fifty people in the audience. So I kept that image in mind as I prepared, imagining all those people sitting in front of me. At that moment, I found myself hoping that the audience would truly understand the new concept "effective workspace" I introduced and appreciate its depth.

Maybe it was the energy of the place or just the excitement building up, but the ideas for how I should deliver the talk came together very clearly.
