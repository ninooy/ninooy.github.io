I arrived on 17 October (Fri) and returned to Korea on 24 October (Fri). Looking back, this trip became a turning point for me.</p> <p>Visiting China especially Shanghai and Hangzhou completely changed my perspective. The level of technology in China right now is astonishing. Whenever I read recent papers, I notice that Chinese researchers appear in almost every author list. And when I occasionally watch robotics videos on YouTube, I often find myself speechless😮. Seeing those very robots in person during the conference was incredible. the performance I had only seen online was happening right in front of me.</p> <p>I’d like to share that experience in detail through this blog.</p> <p>On a more personal note, I also spent wonderful time with my cousin Gun-Wook (건욱), who guided me around Shanghai. I honestly cannot imagine how difficult the trip would have been without his help. I’m also grateful to Seol-Sa-Yeon (설사연), his girlfriend, who took me to some of the most popular spots in the city.</p> <p>So, with all that said</p> <blockquote> <p>Let’s dive into the story.</p> </blockquote> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ip6cw8gfHHI?si=mxSmQEHBMjvZICu5" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" width="auto" height="auto"/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> d4vd - here with me. </div> <blockquote> <p>First Day : much needed catch up after a long time.</p> </blockquote> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_arrive-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_arrive-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_arrive-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_arrive.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_street-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_street-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_street-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_street.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> I arrived at PVG airport. </div> <p>When I went through immigration, a Chinese police officer suddenly stopped me. Since I bulked up to 95 kg, my current face didn’t quite match the photo in my passport. At least, that’s my best guess. They spoke entirely in Chinese, so I had absolutely no idea what they were saying. I just waited for about 30 minutes until they finally approved my entry into Shanghai. In the end, I showed them my conference invitation letter. Honestly, I should have shown it earlier 😅.</p> <p>After that little incident, I met my cousin and his friend. At first, I thought she was just someone interested in Korean culture, you know, the whole K-something syndrome going around these days. But I was completely wrong. She was actually my cousin’s girlfriend, and she kindly offered to drive me home. It was my first time meeting her, and seeing my cousin with a girlfriend made me realize that he’s getting older too… just like me. It felt strangely funny and heart warming at the same time 🤩.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_yang0-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_yang0-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_yang0-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_yang0.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_market-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_market-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_market-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_market.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_yang1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_yang1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_yang1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_yang1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_yang2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_yang2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_yang2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/iros/D1/D1_yang2.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> I went some random restaurant for eating 양꼬치(lamb screwer) </div> <p>With my cousin, we talked about so many things.

That was probably the happiest part of the trip having the kind of conversations you can only really share with family.</p> <p>We talked about a lot of things good news, bad news, life changes and it hit me that we’ve grown a lot. We used to talk only about video games, but now we’re talking about our futures. It really felt like both of us were getting older and becoming more mature.</p> <p>Maybe that’s why the beer tasted extra good that night.
