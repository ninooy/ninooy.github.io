  abstract     = {Optimizing the initial angle of the shoulder’s base
frame is crucial for defining the workspace and enhancing the
manipulation performance of humanoid robotic arms. Previous
studies primarily emphasized geometric analyses, neglecting
dynamic factors, which limits their practical applicability.
This study presents a multi-metric optimization framework
to enhance the dynamic performance of humanoid robotic
arms by optimizing the shoulder’s initial angle. We formulate
a cost function that incorporates torque efficiency, energy
consumption, and overload ratio, utilizing the differential evolu-
tion (DE) algorithm for optimization. Furthermore, to address
the limitations of conventional geometric workspace analysis,
we introduce the concept of effective workspace, integrating
dynamic constraints to quantitatively evaluate the effects of
optimized shoulder angles. We validate the proposed framework
in a hybrid simulation environment combining MuJoCo and
RBDL, using the KIST humanoid and Unitree G1 robotic
arms. Experimental results confirm that the optimized shoulder
angles enhance torque distribution, expanding the effective
workspace by 18.4% and 3.78% for the KIST and Unitree G1
robotic arms, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the
proposed optimization framework enhances manipulation and
dynamic performance as well as energy efficiency and system
reliability, contributing to advancements in humanoid robotic
arm design.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing kinematic design is essential to enhance the performance of humanoid robots. Nevertheless, most existing research focuses on single performance metrics, while real-world applications require comprehensive optimization. This study investigates optimal shoulder joint base frame angles in a virtual MuJoCo-RBDL hybrid environment using the Unitree G1 humanoid. Multi-objective criteria including torque efficiency, overload ratio, energy consumption, and manipulability index were evaluated. The differential-evolution-based optimization identified 14.4° (X-axis) and -2.4° (Z-axis) as optimal angles, improving torque efficiency by 1.1\%, energy efficiency by 3.3\%, and manipulability by 2.3\% compared to the baseline. Findings provide quantitative guidelines for designing efficient 7-DOF humanoid shoulder mechanisms.},
